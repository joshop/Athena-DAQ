# DevBoard
This is a test board for STM32C092 microcontroller and CAN bus. It contains the following components, common to most/all standard boards in the DAQ system:
- STM32C092FCP6 microcontroller, TSSOP-20 package with built in FDCAN
- SN65HVD232QDRG4Q1 CAN transceiver
- SST25PF020B-80-4C-SAE SPI flash memory
- Tag-Connect 6-pin programming header through SWD
All STM32 peripheral pins and the CAN bus are broken out to headers.
